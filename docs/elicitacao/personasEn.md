# Personas

## Introduction

<div align="justify">

&emsp;&emsp;In order to start this document about personas, it is worth emphasizing the importance of this requirement elicitation process, as there are even methodologies and projects that are guided by personas. Personas are archetypes of users, which are created by developers to represent users of the software in question and assist in requirement elicitation.

&emsp;&emsp;This document will also provide a brief explanation of what personas are, how and when they are used.

</div>

### What is a Persona?

<div align="justify">

&emsp;&emsp;Personas are imaginary individuals created by developers through the observation and combination of various different users with extreme profiles within the software. Personas should gather the significant characteristics of a comprehensive group of users. In addition to representing the motivations, interests, and real needs within the project, they help the developer empathize with the user by understanding their personal and business contexts.

</div>

### How to apply?

<div align="justify">

&emsp;&emsp;The first step in applying personas is to identify the different target audiences that the software caters to. Data collection through field research should include information such as the predominant gender, social class, and age range of the users. Additionally, it is important to consider the users' behavioral profiles.

&emsp;&emsp;Once all the user types present in the application have been identified, the creation of fictional personas should be based on the collected user types and profiles. This allows us to form personas with information and characteristics similar to real users, but different from each other. This way, personas will be able to represent the diverse range of users of the service in question.

&emsp;&emsp;According to Courage and Baxter, each project has its own set of personas, typically consisting of three to twelve personas.

&emsp;&emsp;To conclude, each persona should be assigned a name, a story, and needs that aid in embodying this archetype.

&emsp;&emsp;Care should be taken to avoid the pitfalls of designing for anecdotal users or relying on subjective personal observations.

</div>

### When to use?

<div align="justify">

&emsp;&emsp;Personas can be used in different phases of a project. Their main objective is to assist in generating and validating ideas within the project. However, personas can also be used to support the design process and gain a better understanding of user characteristics. They can aid decision-making by being informed by user information.

</div>

## Methodologies

<div align="justify">

&emsp;&emsp;As mentioned earlier in this document, according to Courage and Baxter, each project has its own set of personas, typically consisting of three to twelve personas.

&emsp;&emsp;The personas were developed based on user profiles created through [questionnaire](https://requisitos-de-software.github.io/2023.1-VLC/#/elicitacao/questionario) data collection..

&emsp;&emsp;The images used in the creation of personas were generated by the website [This Person Doest Not Exist](https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en), which uses artificial intelligence to create copyright-free fictional people.

</div>

### Applying to the project

<div align="justify">

&emsp;&emsp;According to Courage and Baxter (2005), we should create at least one persona per user role. Each project has its own set of personas, consisting of three to twelve distinct personas. Therefore, after analyzing the user profile obtained for the users of Banco Central do Brasil, it was decided to use 4 personas. We used 3 personas to cover all the collected user roles and 1 persona that represents a user who doesn't fit the typical user profile. This led to the formulation of the 4 personas for the project.
  
&emsp;&emsp;In this project, we are using personas as a fundamental tool for the construction of the scenario artifact. Personas are fictional representations of real users that help us better understand the needs, behaviors, and goals of our target users.
  
&emsp;&emsp;By creating personas, we essentially create user archetypes with specific characteristics that can represent different segments of our target audience. This allows us to personalize and target our design efforts, making them more user-centered.

&emsp;&emsp;In the scenario, on the other hand, the responsible developer would play the persona, enabling the team to use this tool for requirement elicitation within the project.

</div>

## User Profile

<div align="justify">

&emsp;&emsp;The creation of personas is based on the user profile, represented in Table 1, which was determined from the results of the questionnaire applied by the group.

</div>
	
| Characteristic    | Description                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------|
| Age               | 20-75 years                                  |
| Experience        | Average/low experience with technology       |
| Attitudes         | Academics                                    |
| Primary Tasks     | Watching and organizing videos               |

</div>

## Definition of Personas

<div align="justify">

&emsp;&emsp;Based on the analysis of the user profile and identified primary tasks, the set of personas was developed. The set consists of two primary personas, one secondary persona, and one anti-persona. The number of personas was defined to make them memorable. Having a large set of personas can potentially distance the team from effectively using and empathizing with them.
